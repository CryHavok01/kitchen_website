# My Kitchen Website
A website I built to test my skills and keep my kitchen organized

This is the first website I ever built.  It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.  It involves heavy database use, so it isn't actually functional on GitHub.  If you want to see or play with the real, working version, it's located here: https://jskitchen.000webhostapp.com/

The website uses a database to store information on ingredients I have in my kitchen, as well as recipes I like to make.  It can then compare the ingredients I have to what is required for a recipe, and inform me if I have everything I need to complete the recipe.  After "making" a recipe, it can then update the saved ingredients with the new amounts after subtracting what was used in the recipe.  I also attempted to make an interactive and user-friendly nagivation bar, as well as a detailed explanation of my methodology on each page.
